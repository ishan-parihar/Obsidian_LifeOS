# LifeOS Obsidian Development Plan
## Executive Summary

Objective: Create the complete backend and foundational system for Obsidian LifeOS, excluding AI automation aspects.

Scope: Database architecture, templates, system foundation, and core workflows.

Timeline: 4-6 months for complete foundational implementation

Priority: High - Critical infrastructure development

Success Criteria:

	* All 24 databases fully functional with proper relationships
	* Complete template system for content creation
	* Automated review cycles and synthesis
	* Working dashboards for all major workflows
	* Seamless data flow between system components

## I. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### A. Core Database Hierarchy (Based on Research Results)

	ATOMIC LAYER (5 Databases):
	├── 01-Subjective-Journal      # Internal experiences, emotions, thoughts
	├── 02-Relational-Journal      # Relationships, interactions, social dynamics
	├── 03-Systemic-Journal        # External systems, patterns, observations
	├── 04-Activity-Log            # Time tracking, activities, energy levels
	└── 05-Diet-Log               # Nutrition, supplements, physical health

	REVIEW CYCLES (5 Databases):
	├── 06-Days (Central Synthesis Engine)  # Daily synthesis of all atomic data
	├── 07-Weeks                   # Weekly patterns and insights
	├── 08-Months                  # Monthly themes and progress
	├── 09-Quarters                # Quarterly strategic reviews
	└── 10-Years                   # Annual life assessment

	STRATEGIC LAYER (6 Databases):
	├── 11-Values                  # Core life values and principles
	├── 12-Vision                  # Life vision and purpose statements
	├── 13-Annual-Goals            # Yearly objectives and targets
	├── 14-Quarterly-Goals         # Quarterly milestone goals
	├── 15-Projects                # Active projects with outcomes
	└── 16-Tasks                   # Actionable tasks with contexts

	RESOURCE LAYER (8 Databases):
	├── 17-People (25+ Psychological Fields) # Relationship management
	├── 18-Community               # Community engagement and contributions
	├── 19-Financial-Accounts      # Financial tracking and goals
	├── 20-Financial-Log           # Daily financial transactions
	├── 21-Notes                   # General knowledge and learning
	├── 22-Documents               # Important documents and references
	├── 23-Stories                 # Personal narratives and experiences
	└── 24-Failure-Scenarios       # Risk analysis and contingency planning

### B. Technical Architecture

Data Flow Pattern:

	Atomic Inputs → Daily Synthesis → Weekly Patterns → Monthly Themes → Quarterly Strategy → Annual Vision

Key Technical Challenges:

	1. Cross-database relationships using Dataview and metadata
	2. Automated synthesis without AI (using templates and formulas)
	3. Review cycle automation with periodic notes and templates
	4. Dashboard creation with real-time data aggregation
	5. Template inheritance and modular design
