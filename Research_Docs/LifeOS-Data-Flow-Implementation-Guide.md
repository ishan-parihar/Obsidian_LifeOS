---

## 🔧 Template Fixes Applied

### 1. Weekly Review Template (`weekly-review.md`)
**Before**: Broken queries using incorrect field references
**After**: Fixed queries with proper string conversion
```yaml
# Added hierarchical linking fields
years: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY") %>]]
days: []

# Fixed queries
FROM "Reviews/Days"
WHERE contains(string(this.file.name), string(weeks))
```

### 2. Project Template (`project-template.md`)
**Before**: Missing hierarchical linking fields
**After**: Added complete hierarchy support
```yaml
annual_goals: []
quarters: []
years: []

# Fixed queries
WHERE contains(string(projects), string("<% tp.file.title %>"))
```

### 3. Annual Goal Template (`annual-goal.md`)
**Before**: Incomplete YAML structure
**After**: Full hierarchical linking
```yaml
quarters: []
projects: []
tasks: []

# Added task rollup query
FROM "16-Tasks"
WHERE contains(string(annual_goals), string("<% tp.file.title %>"))
```

### 4. Quarterly Goal Template (`quarterly-goal.md`)
**Before**: Missing task rollup capability
**After**: Complete strategic execution visibility
```yaml
years: []
tasks: []

# Added task rollup
FROM "16-Tasks"
WHERE contains(string(quarterly_goals), string("<% tp.file.title %>"))
```

### 5. Daily Note Template (`daily-note.md`)
**Before**: Incomplete temporal hierarchy
**After**: Full temporal linking
```yaml
quarters: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY-[Q]Q") %>]]
years: [[<% tp.date.now("YYYY") %>]]

# Fixed all atomic log queries
WHERE contains(string(days), string(this.file.name))
```

## 🔄 Hierarchical Data Flow Architecture

### Strategic Execution Flow
```
Vision
├── Annual Goals
│   ├── Quarterly Goals
│   │   ├── Projects
│   │   │   └── Tasks
│   │   └── Tasks (Direct)
│   └── Projects (Direct)
└── Tasks (Direct)
```

### Temporal Hierarchy Flow
```
Year Review
├── Quarterly Reviews
│   ├── Monthly Reviews
│   │   ├── Weekly Reviews
│   │   │   └── Daily Notes
│   │   └── Daily Notes (Direct)
│   └── Weekly Reviews (Direct)
└── Monthly Reviews (Direct)
```

### Atomic Log Rollup Flow
```
Subjective Journal → Daily Notes → Weekly Reviews → Monthly Reviews → Quarterly Reviews → Year Review
Relational Journal → Daily Notes → Weekly Reviews → Monthly Reviews → Quarterly Reviews → Year Review
Systemic Journal → All Strategic Levels + All Temporal Levels
Activity Log → Daily Notes → Weekly Reviews → Monthly Reviews → Quarterly Reviews → Year Review
Diet Log → Daily Notes → Weekly Reviews → Monthly Reviews → Quarterly Reviews → Year Review
Financial Log → All Temporal Levels
```

## 🔗 Bidirectional Navigation Capabilities

### Top-Down Navigation (Strategic → Tactical)
1. **Annual Goals** can now see all supporting:
   - Quarterly Goals
   - Projects
   - Tasks
   - Systemic Issues

2. **Quarterly Goals** can now see all supporting:
   - Projects
   - Tasks
   - Systemic Issues
   - Risk Scenarios

3. **Projects** can now see all:
   - Tasks
   - Systemic Issues
   - People involved
   - Progress metrics

### Bottom-Up Navigation (Tactical → Strategic)
1. **Tasks** now show their contribution to:
   - Projects
   - Quarterly Goals
   - Annual Goals

2. **Daily Notes** now aggregate all:
   - Subjective Journal entries
   - Relational Journal entries
   - Activities
   - Diet logs
   - Systemic issues

### Cross-Temporal Navigation
1. **Any level** can navigate to:
   - Previous/next period
   - Related periods
   - Aggregated data from sub-periods

2. **Dashboard** provides complete visibility across:
   - All strategic levels
   - All temporal horizons
   - All atomic log types

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### YAML Structure Standards

#### Hierarchical Linking Fields
```yaml
# Strategic alignment
annual_goals: []
quarterly_goals: []
projects: []
tasks: []

# Temporal alignment
years: []
quarters: []
months: []
weeks: []
days: []
```

#### Query Pattern Standards
```dataview
# Standard rollup pattern
FROM "TargetFolder"
WHERE contains(string(source_field), string(target_value))

# Cross-reference pattern
FROM "SourceFolder"
WHERE file.link != this.file.link AND (
  contains(string(projects), string(this.projects)) OR
  contains(string(quarterly_goals), string(this.quarterly_goals))
)
```

### String Conversion Fix
**Problem**: Dataview couldn't compare arrays directly
**Solution**: Always use `string()` function for comparisons
```dataview
# Before (broken)
WHERE weeks = this.file.name

# After (working)
WHERE contains(string(this.file.name), string(weeks))
```

4. See all tasks contributing to this annual goal

### Example 2: From Daily Note to Strategic Impact
1. Open any Daily Note
2. View all atomic log entries for that day
3. Navigate to Weekly Review to see patterns
4. Navigate to Monthly/Quarterly/Annual Reviews for strategic context

### Example 3: Master Dashboard Usage
1. Open LifeOS Dashboard

## 🎯 Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Update Existing Files**: Apply new YAML structures to existing notes
2. **Test Queries**: Verify all dataview queries work correctly
3. **Create Dashboard**: Generate master dashboard for navigation
4. **Training**: Learn the new navigation patterns

### File Update Priority
1. **High Priority**: All Strategic files (Goals, Projects, Tasks)
2. **Medium Priority**: All Review files (Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Annual)
3. **Low Priority**: Atomic log files (they already work with new queries)

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Update all strategic files with new YAML fields
2. **Phase 2**: Test all bidirectional navigation
3. **Phase 3**: Create personal dashboard instances
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize queries based on usage patterns
