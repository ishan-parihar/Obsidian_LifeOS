# Areas of Responsibility

Your Areas of Responsibility represent the key domains of your life that require ongoing attention and management. These are not projects or tasks, but rather ongoing commitments that define who you are and what matters to you.

## 🎯 Purpose

Areas of Responsibility help you:
- Maintain balance across all life domains
- Ensure nothing important falls through the cracks
- Provide context for prioritizing projects and tasks
- Create a framework for regular life reviews

4. **Tasks**: What specific actions need to be taken?
5. **Resources**: What information or tools do I need?

## 🔄 Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly**: Quick check-in on high-priority areas
- **Monthly**: Deep review of 1-2 areas  
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive review of all areas
- **Annually**: Major reassessment and realignment

> **Tip**: Keep your areas manageable (5-10 total). Too many areas become overwhelming and defeat the purpose of providing focus.
