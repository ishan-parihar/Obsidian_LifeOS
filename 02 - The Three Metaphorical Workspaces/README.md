# 02 - The Three Metaphorical Workspaces

## Operational Philosophy

The LifeOS operates through three distinct workspaces, each serving a specific function in the rhythm of personal organization:

**The Observatory** → Reflect and strategize (altitude perspective)
**The Forge** → Execute with focus (contained flow)
**The Engine Room** → Access resources (centralized intelligence)

This creates a clear operational rhythm: plan from altitude, execute in containment, draw from centralized resources.
