## üîó Strategic Integration Architecture

### Vertical Integration (Hierarchy)
Each level links to levels above and below:
- **Values** ‚Üí **Vision** ‚Üí **Annual** ‚Üí **Quarterly** ‚Üí **Projects** ‚Üí **Tasks**
- Bottom feeds learning upward
- Top feeds direction downward

### Horizontal Integration (Cross-Domain)
- **Strategic levels** connect to all Four Domain Workspaces
- **Tactical execution** links to Metaphorical Workspaces
- **Review cycles** inform continuous optimization

### Risk Management Integration
- **Failure Scenarios** link to all strategic levels
- **Early warning systems** monitor across domains
- **Response protocols** activate appropriate workspace resources

## üìä Performance Intelligence System

### Success Metrics by Level
- **Values**: Alignment consistency and integration depth
- **Vision**: Clarity, inspiration, and directional accuracy
- **Annual Goals**: Archetype mastery and capacity building
- **Quarterly Goals**: OKR achievement and learning extraction
- **Projects**: Health metrics and stakeholder value
- **Tasks**: Completion rates and efficiency ratios

### Learning Feedback Loops
- **Daily** ‚Üí **Weekly** ‚Üí **Monthly** ‚Üí **Quarterly** ‚Üí **Annual**
- Pattern recognition across timescales
- System optimization based on performance data
- Capacity building through challenge integration

### Predictive Intelligence
- **Failure Scenario monitoring** for early intervention
- **Resource requirement forecasting**
- **Energy management optimization**
- **Relationship maintenance scheduling**

## üéØ Strategic to Tactical Translation Protocol

### Decision Filters
- **Values Test**: Does this align with core principles?
- **Vision Test**: Does this move me toward my future self?
- **Capacity Test**: Do I have or can I develop required skills?
- **Energy Test**: Do I have sustainable energy for this?
- **Relationship Test**: Does this support my connection quality?

### Priority Framework
1. **Strategic Alignment** (linked to annual/quarterly goals)
2. **Energy Capacity** (current and projected availability)
3. **Relationship Impact** (effect on connection quality)
4. **Risk Assessment** (threat levels and mitigation)
5. **Resource Efficiency** (time, money, attention optimization)

### Execution Protocol
1. **Strategic Intent** (why this matters)
2. **Success Definition** (what done looks like)
3. **Resource Allocation** (what's needed)
4. **Risk Assessment** (what could go wrong)
5. **Learning Integration** (what to extract)
