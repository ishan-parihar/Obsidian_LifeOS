## Migration Overview

### Original System Analysis
The previous Life Management System provided:
- Basic area of responsibility organization
- Simple project and task management
- Weekly review templates
- Dashboard functionality

### LifeOS Integration Points
The original components have been redistributed across the new LifeOS architecture:

**Areas of Responsibility** â†’ **Four Domain Workspaces**
- Health & Fitness â†’ Intelligence and Integration (Personal Development)
- Career Development â†’ Architecture (Professional Practice)

**Project & Task Management** â†’ **Database Architecture**
- Projects Inbox â†’ Projects Database
- Tasks Inbox â†’ Tasks Database with Sprint Management
- Templates â†’ Enhanced templates within new structure

**Review Systems** â†’ **The Workbench Act I-III**
- Weekly Reviews â†’ Days/Weeks/Monthly/Quarterly Review Cycles
- System maintenance â†’ Integrated across all three Metaphorical Workspaces

**Dashboard** â†’ **The Workbench Central Command Center**
- Simple dashboard â†’ Three-Act operational progression

- Gradual transfer of ongoing projects and tasks
- Learning period for new functionality
- System optimization based on usage patterns

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start using LifeOS daily activation (Act I)
2. Migrate active projects to new Projects Database
3. Transition tasks to sprint-based system (Current Sprint)
4. Begin using comprehensive review cycles
5. Explore advanced features as comfort increases

### Legacy Templates Reference

**Template Evolution Tracking:**
- Original templates preserved here for reference
- Enhanced versions available in new architecture
- Best practices incorporated into new framework
- Learning archived for continuous improvement
