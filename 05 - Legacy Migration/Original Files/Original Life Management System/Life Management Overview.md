# Life Management Overview

## System Philosophy

This Life Management System is designed to help you achieve clarity, focus, and balance across all areas of your life. It combines proven productivity methodologies with the flexibility of Obsidian to create a personalized system that grows with you.

## Core Components

### 1. Areas of Responsibility
Your major life domains that require ongoing attention and management. These serve as the foundation for organizing projects, tasks, and goals.

### 2. Project Management
Structured approach to larger initiatives with clear goals, timelines, and deliverables. Projects are linked to specific areas of responsibility.

### 3. Task Management
Atomic action items that can be completed in a single work session. Tasks are linked to projects or areas for context.

### 4. Review System
Regular maintenance cycles (daily, weekly, monthly) that keep the system current and aligned with your priorities.

## Workflow Integration

### Capture → Process → Organize → Review → Do

1. **Capture**: Collect all incoming items in designated inboxes
2. **Process**: Decide what each item means and what action is required
3. **Organize**: Store items in appropriate locations with relevant context
4. **Review**: Regularly review and update the system
5. **Do**: Execute actions with clarity and purpose
