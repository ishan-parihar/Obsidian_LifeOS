# LifeOS Obsidian Implementation

Welcome to your LifeOS (Life Operating System) implementation in Obsidian! This system implements a dual-hierarchy convergence model: temporal review cycles (bottom-up synthesis) intersecting with strategic operational systems (top-down execution), creating a dynamic junction point that reveals "what matters most right now."

## System Architecture

### Primary Systems Hierarchy
1. **THE WORKBENCH** (Dashboard Layer) - Your daily operational hub
2. **THE OBSERVATORY** (Strategic Layer) - Your strategic planning and review center
3. **THE FORGE** (Execution Layer) - Your task execution and sprint management
4. **THE ENGINE ROOM** (Resource Layer) - Your resource and relationship management

### Data Flow Architecture
- **Upward Flow**: Atomic logs → Daily synthesis → Weekly reviews → Monthly reviews → Quarterly reviews → Annual reviews
- **Downward Flow**: Values → Vision → Annual Goals → Quarterly Goals → Projects → Tasks
- **Convergence Point**: Review cycles correlate with operational systems to identify priority actions

## Getting Started

### Required Plugins
Install these community plugins through Obsidian's community plugins manager:
- Dataview - All query logic
- Templater - Advanced templating with scripts
- Tasks - Task management
- Calendar - Temporal navigation
- Periodic Notes - Weekly/monthly/quarterly notes
- Buttons - Interactive elements
- Meta Bind - Dynamic frontmatter inputs
- DB Folder - Database-like views
- Kanban - Sprint/project boards
- Tracker - Habit/metric tracking

### Core Workflow

#### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning (Ignition)**: Open Workbench dashboard, review today's note, check current sprint tasks, review systemic issues
2. **Throughout Day (Capture)**: Quick-capture logs via templates, use mobile/desktop for logging
3. **Evening (Synthesis)**: Run synthesis generator, review perspectives, add night wind-down reflection

#### Weekly Workflow
1. **Sunday Evening (Review)**: Open Observatory dashboard, create week note, run aggregation, synthesize wins/challenges/lessons
2. **Monday Morning (Planning)**: Review quarterly goals alignment, assign tasks to current sprint, set weekly focus

## Key Components

### Dashboards
- `Workbench.md` - Daily operations center
- `Observatory.md` - Strategic review and alignment
- `Forge.md` - Execution and sprint management
- `Engine-Room.md` - Resource management

### Logs
- **Subjective Journal** - Internal emotional/psychological states
- **Relational Journal** - Interpersonal interactions tracking
- **Systemic Journal** - Operational issues/incidents tracking
- **Activity Log** - Time and activity tracking
- **Diet Log** - Nutritional tracking

### Review Cycles
- Daily notes with 15+ synthesis perspectives
- Weekly reviews with task completion metrics
- Monthly reviews with outcome assessment
- Quarterly reviews with OKR tracking
- Annual reviews with comprehensive life assessment

### Strategic Elements
- Values & Core Principles
- Vision statements by life aspect
- Annual and Quarterly Goals (OKRs)
- Projects with constraints and KPIs
- Failure Scenarios (Anti-Goals) for risk management
- People Database with sophisticated profiling

## Using Templates
All templates are in `000-System/Templates/`:
- Use `daily-note.md` for daily reviews (works with Daily Notes plugin)
- Use `weekly-review.md` for weekly reviews (works with Periodic Notes)
- Use `project-template.md` for creating new projects
- Use `person-template.md` for adding new people
- Use `subjective-log.md`, `relational-log.md`, and `systemic-log.md` for capturing different types of logs

## Advanced Features
- **15 Synthesis Perspectives**: Each daily note includes synthesis from different perspectives
- **Sprint Management**: Tasks can be assigned to current/next/backlog sprints
- **Relationship Intelligence**: Detailed profiles for tracking and managing relationships
- **Risk Management**: Failure scenarios with proactive and reactive protocols
- **Cross-linking**: All components are interconnected through Dataview queries

## Maintenance
Regular maintenance tasks:
- Update People database with connection frequencies
- Review and update quarterly and annual goals
- Assess and update failure scenarios
- Maintain project KPIs and progress metrics
- Review and update core values and vision statements

The LifeOS is designed to be a living system that evolves with your life. Start with the basics and gradually incorporate more advanced features as you become comfortable with the system.
